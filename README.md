# coding-quiz

## Description
This project is a coding quiz designed to test the user's knowledge of selected coding topics.  It asks the user a series of questions, marks their answers as correct or incorrect, and stores their names with their scores in local storage so that quiz scores can be accessed after the quiz is complete.  The quiz has a timer which allots the user 10 seconds per question, and causes the quiz to timeout when the allotted time is used up.

The project allowed me to practice working with time intervals, event listeners, local storage, and web APIs.  It also allowed me to practiced working with targeting, appending, and removing elements from the HTML DOM.
