# coding-quiz

## Description
This project is a coding quiz designed to test the user's knowledge of selected coding topics.  It asks the user a series of questions, marks their answers as correct or incorrect, and stores their names with their scores in local storage so that quiz scores can be accessed after the quiz is complete.  The quiz has a timer which allots the user 10 seconds per question, and causes the quiz to timeout when the allotted time is used up.

The project allowed me to practice working with time intervals, event listeners, local storage, and web APIs.  It also allowed me to practiced working with targeting, appending, and removing elements from the HTML DOM.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
